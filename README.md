# polynet

This repository aims to archive the nets of polyhedra created by [software tools](http://masc.cs.gmu.edu/wiki/Origami) developed by the [MASC group](http://masc.cs.gmu.edu) at George Mason University. 

A net of a polyhedron is a type of 2D unfolding of the polyhedron; See detailed description in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_(polyhedron)

For the general public, these nets can be printed and then folded to re-create the polyhedral mesh in 3D. Photos of fabricatedd models from these nets and videos will also be provided when possible.
